# Single Linked List

* Good when insertions and deletes at the beginning are required

* In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.

## Complexities

### Time Complexity

| Access    | Search    | Insertion | Deletion  |
| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| O(n)      | O(n)      | O(1)      | O(n)      |

* Inserting on the beginning or end of the list
* Deletion can happen at any place inside the list

### Space Complexity

O(n)

### Simple Reverse

```javascript
/**
   * Reverse a linked list.
   * @returns {LinkedList}
   */
  reverse() {
    let currNode = this.head;
    let prevNode = null;
    let nextNode = null;

    while (currNode) {
      // Store next node.
      nextNode = currNode.next;

      // Change next node of the current node so it would link to previous node.
      currNode.next = prevNode;

      // Move prevNode and currNode nodes one step forward.
      prevNode = currNode;
      currNode = nextNode;
    }

    // Reset head and tail.
    this.tail = this.head;
    this.head = prevNode;

    return this;
  }
```
